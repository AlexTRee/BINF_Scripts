Bioinformatics
==============

Scripts I wrote for my two summer internships. See branches.

- Computational Biology/Chemistry Intern, May 2016 – August 2016
    Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Diego, CA 92121
    Under the supervision of Dr. Lidio Meireles.
      Integrating and automate workflow of ligand-based drug design software FTrees with Vertex’s internal software and chemical database to allow medicinal chemists to find similar compounds and generate new drug design ideas.  Generate in-house knowledge space using customized reagents and supporting python scripts for VSL (Vertex Scripting Library). Help gene editing group troubleshooting in CRISPR-Cas9 analysis. 

- Bioinformatics/Gene Targeting Design Intern, May 2015 – August 2015
    Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY 10591
    Under the supervision of Dr. Alejandro Mujica.
      Worked at Velocigene department, shadowing designers in allele design group for multiple gene targeting design projects and developed a web interface for Velocigene's CRISPR-Cas9 mediated Amplicon-Seq analysis pipeline with few optimizations. Worked at BiCS group, utilized a string matching algorithm to filter and format BLAT search results (the final successful rate is 98.3%), plus data migration and visualization. Developed a new sync method to sync tracks between Velociweb and UCSC Genome Browser, helped maintain Regeneron's several production servers and websites (including ResearchIT group’s Test and Development server, Velociweb and REGN mirror of UCSC Genome Browser).
